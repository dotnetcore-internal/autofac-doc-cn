Autofac offers integration into several ASP.NET application types. The integration libraries provide features like easy connection of your Autofac container to the application lifecycle as well as support for things like :doc:`per-request component lifetime <../lifetime/instance-scope>`.

**These pages explain ASP.NET classic integration.** If you are using ASP.NET Core, :doc:`see the ASP.NET Core integration page <aspnetcore>`.
